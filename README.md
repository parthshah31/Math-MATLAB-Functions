# Math-MATLAB-Functions
A collection of useful functions and methods implemented in MATLAB

The list at the moment is:
averagedot.m
  this function calculates the average dot product of unit vectors. It take a unit vector u of dimension d. It then generate n 		vectors of dimension d and creates a matrix U of dimension (n,d). The dot product of u with each column is calculated and then 	divided by the number of columns to get the average. For repeated trials the value should approach 2/pi as the value should 			reflect a computational version of the integral of cos(x).
